## General info
This is a small project where a responsive website is designed for electronic shop. During this current pandemic situation, lockdown has been
announced in most of the cities. Due to this, many local shop owners could not sell thier products. Online marketing is a best solution for this problem.
So the main objective of this project is to create a website for electronic shop, so that the local shop owners can run their business through online. To create this website, 
I have mainly used HTML5 and CSS3. I have used bootstrap in order to make the website responsive(mobile view).
